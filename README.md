## Acknowledgement
This project was developed as part of my Final Year Project (FYP) for the completion of my undergraduate studies. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor for their continuous guidance, support, and valuable feedback throughout the development of this work.

This project made use of publicly available benchmark datasets to test and validate the proposed Network-Based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). Specifically, the CICIoT2023 dataset (Pinto et al., 2023) and the CICIoMT2024 dataset (Dadkhah et al., 2024) provided by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity were fundamental for evaluating the systemâ€™s performance in realistic IoT and IoMT attack scenarios.
